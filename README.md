# Marker-Spinner
## Table of contents

### Week 12 
This week we made the decision to change our project. Our original project was an automatic chicken feeder, which would feed chickens automatically, obviously. Our new project is now a Marker Spinner for Mr. Manning(Physics Teacher). Considering that we just changed our project we haven't yet found a lot of resources or issues to be solved. What we have done this week is talk to Mr. Manning, created a design, and started on code. Next week we plan to meet with out mentor to get some ideas, start CAD, continue code, and do more research.
