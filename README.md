### Week 12 
This week we decided to change our project. Our original project was an automatic chicken feeder, that would feed chickens automatically. Our new project is now a Marker Spinner for Mr. Manning(Physics Teacher). Considering that we just changed our project we haven't yet found a lot of resources or issues to be solved. What we have done this week is talk to Mr. Manning, create a design, and start on code. Next week we plan to meet with our mentor to get some ideas, start CAD, continue code, and do more research.

### Week 13
I worked on the code, while Hope worked on the prototype. We’re using 2 D.C motors and might even need to buy faster ones. Credits to Graham and Malachi for giving us their Github page to use their code; that is the only new source we found. We also found Dylan Hensley’s onshape about Mr. Manning’s marker spinner. With the code, I couldn’t get it to work in the beginning. We’re almost done with our prototype, and the two dc motors are working, understand the code, and figuring out how we want our design to look. Finish the prototype get Mr. Manning’s input about the motors and go on from there and have a meeting with Skye.

### Week 14 
This week we finished up our prototype and met with our mentor Skye. We decided on two different ideas for the wheel of the marker spinner to spin. The first idea is to use an axle and have the wheel spin in the middle to balance the weight of the markers. The second idea is to have attachments to the DC motors and have them attached to the wheel. We discovered that the weight of the markers can impact the balance of the wheel so that's where our new ideas came from. Coming up with a solid design went okay, and getting our prototype to work was a bit difficult. Our plan for next week is to start CAD design, continue working on code, and maybe update our prototype.

### What is the problem you are trying to solve?
Trying to save drying markers

### What are the requirements for this assignment?
The requirements are Pico, breadboard, LCD, H-bridge motor driver, plugs, 3D printed materials, and acrylic sheets


# February 


## Week 1
Mariam: After our brainstorming and finally deciding on our project we started doing research based on our project. I started researching how to get a D.C motor working. By the end of the first week, I found some sources to get me started. 

Hope: This week we met with our UVA mentor Skye. She gave us a couple of ideas on how to go about our design. We had some problems with how to keep the axle from sliding and how to attach the DC motors to the axle. She gave us the idea to use rubber bushings or stoppers to keep everything in place. We bought a pretty cool switch that lights up when you flick it on.

## Sources: 
Graham and Malachi
[Graham and Malachi Github](https://github.com/Graham913/G-Hog-mapper-notebook)
I used their motor code

[How to Use Your Raspberry Pi Pico With DC Motors](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dc-motors-raspberry-pi-pico)
This source helped me wire up my motors and the code helped me understand how I want my motors to work

[How to Use Your Raspberry Pi Pico With DC Motors](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dc-motors-raspberry-pi-pico)
This source kind of helped me know how to get started and I used their code to see if it was going to work, but it didn't. Later I found out that Graham and Malachi had already done their code for the D.C motor, so I asked if I could use their code and they said yes! I used their code and changed it a little bit and it worked!!!! YAYAYAYA Best day!

## Week 2
Mariam: Now that I was done with the D.C. motors I worked on adding a button. wiring a button wasn't hard, but coding it was. Just because I didn't know where to add the button code and how to connect it so that it worked with the D.C motor. and it took me a day or 2 to code-wire it and connect it to the Pico.

Hope: This week I did more research on what would work to keep the axle in place. The rubber bushings were our first idea but we couldn’t find ones that fit what we were looking for. Our second idea was to use bearings instead, allowing the axle to move more freely and efficiently.


## Sources:
Mr. Miller
Thanks to him he helped me code it by adding an if statement and understand how to code works and where to put

## Week 3 
Mariam: After I was done getting the button worked with the motors, I thought I was done, but I wasn't :/ Mr. Manning wanted an LCD now, I was like okay. I started doing research and I found some useful but not useful sources. Then I found out that Ellen was doing an LCD, so I went to her Github page and I noticed that her LCD code was different than what I was looking for. So I moved on and did some more research. I did research this whole week

Hope: This week I began to work on a way to attach the markers to the wheel itself. When Skye first came she gave us some ideas with marker grips. So I took that idea and tweaked it a bit. I came up with the idea of using
## Sources: 
[gventre04 LCD Button](https://github.com/gventre04/CircuitPython/blob/master/lcd_button.py)
This source helped me know how to connect my button code with LCD so that it could work 

[How to use an I2C LCD Display with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/lcd-display-raspberry-pi-pico)
The wiring diagram was helpful when first I started to wire an LCD 

[Using an LCD with a Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.penguintutor.com/programming/pico-lcd)
Their code was helpful to start me off and the wiring diagram they had was super helpful because it had a button and I had no clue how to wire the button so that it's connected to a motor and an LCD


## Week 4 
Mariam: This week Sky came and we talked to her about our process and she talked to me about how I can use a switch instead of an LCD, so I talked to Mr. Manning about it and he said NO and that he wants an LCD. He didn't want to let me go easy, so It took me another few days to code the LCD and I got it done! 

Hope: This week I started our new base. This week I worked on creating a better base for our marker spinner. Skye met with us and gave me some tips on how to make it easier. Instead of making separate parts for the legs and base, I combined them. It was a bit challenging because of the dimensions of our base but I figured it out.

## Week 5
Mariam: I showed Mr. Manning the LCD and he was like add a countdown to it now. And I was are you serious?, so I did some research and found good sources, and added the countdown. After I was done I started to combine my code and my code was officially done! I thought I was done, but when I realized that I needed to shut down the whole system, and to do that I needed to divide the voltage between the Pico and the H-bridge driver. I had a lot of trouble with that. After trying for days I gave up. So I went to Mr. Manning and we tried to solve the problem, but we couldn't so we decided to go with 2 cables. So currently I am waiting for the cable to come so I can connect it. I will also need to commend my code and I will officially be done! 

Hope: This week I researched cables to buy for our project. I also finished up the box of our base and added the joints for it. I struggled a bit with adding the t-slots because the walls were not thick enough. Next week I plan to 3D-print test brackets for our axle finish up the base and start on the brackets for the markers

# March

## Week 1
Mariam: I was waiting to arrive, I didn't do anything else
Hope: This week I worked on designing the marker cap and base of our project. I came up with a problem, the cap was too loose and I had to go back and increase the size of the indents on the cap to keep it from slipping. The base has been a whole mess considering the t-slot joints have been a disaster to work with.

## Week 2
Mariam: Today my switch came and I worked on it. I also started to draw the wiring diagram. Hope and I realized that the switch is too big and we did not like it :(. It was lowkey weird because it had three bracks to solder which I was confused about and how I should solder, so Hope and I agreed that we would not be using this switch

Here is our final wiring diagram

Hope: 

### Week 3
Mariam: This week I started soldering and the first thing I soldered was the pico and the H-bridge on the board 

Before soldering, I put everything on the board making sure it fits. At first, I thought we needed more space, but then I realized that this should be enough space since we don't need a lot of things

I soldered everything on the board and I was happy with the way it came out

### Week 4

Mariam: I started soldering the LCD to the pico and it was a pain. I struggled so much with soldering this because when I soldered one wire the other one would come out because it was touching the tip of the solder. But I got it done that week, so it took me that whole week to solder the LCD :

## April

### Week 1
During spring break nothing happened 

### Week 2
Mariam: I came back to school on Monday and left on Tuesday for the rest of the week due to Eid (celebration after Ramadan) 
Hope: This week I continued to work on CAD. The same problems continued to arise and 
### Week 3
Mariam: Finally after I was  back I started working on soldering the motors and got it done that day :)

The next day I started getting the button attacked and the other pins on the H-bridge and was done 

Here is the picture of that week

### Week 4

Mariam: After I was done with soldering I thought I was done, but nope I was wrong. Right after I plugged them in, the LCD was turned on except for the motors. I was so frustrated and confused as to why it wasn't working because I remember soldering it correctly. So I had to go back and check my wiring. Everything was fine so I checked the code to see if the pins are matching to my pico and it sure did. I didn't know what else to do so I told Mr. Miller and he checked the motors with the Volta meter and they were fine. So he told me to check for any loose wires especially check the sleep and power wires. After checking them they looked fine, so he suggested I should put a little bit more solder on them and after doing that it worked. I was so happy and done at the same time :)

## May

### Week 1
Hope: This week I worked on adding finishing touches to the base of our project. It was a struggle because I had to remake the base again due to some complications, which was a bit challenging to work with but I got it done.  
Mariam: I made the presentation so we could present when the UVA students come

### Week 2
Hope: This week I laser cut the pieces to our base. I began the assembly process as well. I also ran into some challenges with the assembly of our base. The problem was our acrylic parts kept breaking and the distance between the two motors was too short for the axle to fit, the axle was too long anyway so I just decided to cut it down. 
Mariam: I still worked on the presentation and we presented it

### Week 3
Both of us are now just working on the assembly and we have run into some problems again. Things are not fitting how they were in Onshape so that's an issue. Another is that some acrylic pieces may need some modification.

### Week 4 
Mariam: I worked on documentation and my final reaction
Hope: I am working on making design adjustments and plan on reprinting some parts 

### Final Reflection
Mariam: Doing a project for the first time where we have real customers is amazing. I never thought I could use my engineering skills to make something for someone else. When I first started coding for this project I had no clue how to start it or where to start from. I started researching how the D.C motors work and I did find some useful resources, but they were not very helpful. Later I found out that Graham and Malachi had already started coding for the D.C motors, so I got their code and had to figure out how I wanted it to work for me and that was the challenging part cause I didn't know how I wanted the motors to work. After figuring that out I had to change only a few parts of the code with Mr. Millers' help. Then I moved on to adding a button and an LCD. Coding was pretty challenging there were days when I was lost and didn't know what to do, but I always found my way back up with the help of Mr. Miller and Sky. Overall I had fun doing this my favorite part of this project was soldering because it just made me happy to see I am finally done and ready to wrap everything up. Overall I enjoyed doing this project. I am happy knowing that our project will be used for goods when I graduate.

Hope: Doing this project I learned
