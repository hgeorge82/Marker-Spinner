### Week 12 
This week we decided to change our project. Our original project was an automatic chicken feeder, that would feed chickens automatically. Our new project is now a Marker Spinner for Mr. Manning(Physics Teacher). Considering that we just changed our project we haven't yet found a lot of resources or issues to be solved. What we have done this week is talk to Mr. Manning, create a design, and start on code. Next week we plan to meet with our mentor to get some ideas, start CAD, continue code, and do more research.

### Week 13
I worked on the code, while Hope worked on the prototype. We’re using 2 D.C motors and we might even need to buy faster ones. Credits to Graham and Malachi for giving us their Github page to use their code and that is the only new source that we found. We also found Dylan Hensley’s onshape about Mr. Manning’s marker spinner. With the code, I couldn’t get it to work in the beginning. Everything, we’re almost done with our prototype and the two D.C motors are working. Understanding the code and figuring out how we want our design to look like. Finish the prototype get Mr. Manning’s input about the motors and go on from there and have a meeting with Skye.

### Week 14 
This week we finished up our prototype and met with our mentor Skye. We decided on two different ideas for the wheel of the marker spinner to spin. The first idea is to use an axle and have the wheel spin in the middle to balance the weight of the markers. The second idea is to have attachments to the DC motors and have them attached to the wheel. We discovered that the weight of the markers can impact the balance of the wheel so that's where our new ideas came from. Coming up with a solid design went ok and just getting our prototype to work was a bit difficult. Our plan for next week is to start CAD design, continue working on code, and maybe update our prototype.
